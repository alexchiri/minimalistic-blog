# Link blogging

Link blogging is something I wanted to do for some time, but couldn't do with [ghost.org](https://ghost.org) and hacking it in wasn't that easy, at least not for me. Although it is not the main reason for starting to write this custom blog, it is an important one, especially when it is so easy to do.

The first blogger I noticed doing this is [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), the inventor of Markdown and it looks like a good way to keep writing things, without spending a lot of time. Perfect for people who don't have a lot of time for writing a blog, but still have something to say.

## But what is link blogging? 
Wikipedia explains it pretty well in the [linklog article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog).

Basically, a link blog post is linking to some other article/page/post. So when you click the title of the link blog post, you are taken to the linked url instead of the page of the blog post. 

That doesn't mean that the link blog post doesn't have a link of its own or any content. [John](http://daringfireball.net/) has a star near the title that points to the permalink of the post, [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) have a link at the end of the post. Also, most of the time link blog posts contain quotes from the linked article and also some personal comments of the link blog author.

In the first incarnation of link blogging on [minimalistic-blog](https://github.com/alexchiri/minimalistic-blog) I added a small icon to the right of the link blog posts for the permalink and in admin area you can add a link to each blog post you create.
