# minimalistic-blog
A very minimalistic blog done in ReactJS.

The intention with this project is to experiment with ReactJS while doing something useful: replace my [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog.
I don't intend to get even close to the features that Ghost offers, although there's one feature I want to implement that they don't have: link blogging.

This document is a stub for now, will add more information as the project takes more shape. 
Will also write several posts as I go, about some of the challenges I encounter, you can find them below.

## Posts, challenges, useful stuff and other things I wanted to share
